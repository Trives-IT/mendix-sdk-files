Setup:

- Follow the Mendix tutorial on how to setup a Typescript project

- Create a folder named 'config' in this project's root folder
- In it, put a file named 'config.json' that contains the following JSON snippet:

{
"projectid": "44ad0bb8-dce0-4a1d-b123-123abd871f7f",
"mendixtoken": "4g442gtMzKtKxQy8aKFnFfVg7Kt54HuWAK1bSSSswfzsdhsUZ6DFGatXW6XHCQyG3RLzraHjhiAi3dh7QkoaGuKdSstxS7okLRGy",
"branch": "main"
}

- Replace the projectid with the ID of the project you want to use
- Replace the mendixtoken with the one you generated
- (Optional) Replace the branch name if you don't want to use the main branch of your project
